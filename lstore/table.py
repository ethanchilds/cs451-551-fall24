"""
The Table class provides the core of our relational storage functionality. All columns are 64-bit
integers in this implementation. Users mainly interact with tables through queries. Tables provide 
a logical view of the actual physically stored data and mostly manage the storage and retrieval of 
data. Each table is responsible for managing its pages and requires an internal page directory that, 
given a RID, returns the actual physical location of the record. The table class should also manage 
the periodical merge of its corresponding page ranges.
