"""
The Query class provides standard SQL operations such as insert, select, update, delete, and sum. 
The select function returns all the records matching the search key (if any), and only the projected 
columns of the matching records are returned. The insert function will insert a new record in the 
table. All columns should be passed a non-NULL value when inserting. The update function 
updates values for the specified set of columns. The delete function will delete the record with the
specified key from the table. The sum function will sum over the values of the selected column for 
a range of records specified by their key values. We query tables by direct function calls rather 
than parsing SQL queries.
